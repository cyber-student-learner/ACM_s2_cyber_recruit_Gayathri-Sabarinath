Challenge description:
In this challenge, an HTML file was provided along with a hint referencing the “birth” of HTML.
The task is to find the flag by analyzing the file and the hint to find the flag.

My approach:
I started the challenge by analyzing the given html code. I couldn’t find any clue from the code. I then saved the code as a .html file and opened it. The page contained several hidden Base-64 life fragments and an author helper that decoded them. However, the result of the decoding said“[decode failed or not valid base64]”. This meant that the file did not contain the flag. The page also included “Nothing to see here—move along.” So, I concluded that the flag is not in the webpage but and analyzed the hint. It said “I think you have a quite good knowledge on html and its birth. so find me??” So I reserched about the birth of html. Since the hint said ‘find me’, I concluded that the flag is the founder of html.
