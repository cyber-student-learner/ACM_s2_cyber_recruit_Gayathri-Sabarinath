Challenge 4:

Challenge description:
This challenge included an image and a storyline. The storyline also included the features of the structure in the image.
The task was the identify the structure and the state in which the structure exists.

My approach:
Since I couldn’t identify the structure from the image given, I analyzed the hints given. Then I searched for “The Well That Has No Shadow”. I couldn’t find anything useful. So I searched for wells that have repeating stone stair geometry. I got a few options. After searching through them I found the structure given in the image.

Tool used:
Google
