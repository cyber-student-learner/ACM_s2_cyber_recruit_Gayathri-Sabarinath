Challenge 1:
Challenge description:
An anonymous investigator recovered a photograph from an old archive linked to a series of ritualistic crimes.
The image contained no metadata, timestamps, coordinates, or filename clues.

The cropped interior image showed:
Chandeliers made of human bones
Skulls arranged symmetrically
Gothic vaulting

Alongside the image, the following quote was found:
"Let conversation cease. Let laughter flee.
This is the place where death delights in helping the living."

Task:
To find the exact name of the place and its city.

Approach:
First, I analyzed the architectural clues in the image: chandeliers made of bones, skulls arranged symmetrically, and Gothic vaulting. Found out that architectural structures made out of bones are called ossuaries. On further research about ossuaries, I found out that the image given is of the Sedlec Ossuary, commonly known as the "Bone Church" located in a suburb of Kutna Hora in the Czech Republic. Studied about the ossuary and its architectural features.Finally I studied about the quote given to make sure that the answer is right and found out that the function of the ossuary(preserving human remains) is related to the quote. Hence came to the conclusion that the answer is Sedlec Ossuary.
